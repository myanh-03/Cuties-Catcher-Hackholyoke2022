# What it does
In this game, the player uses their hands to control the basket in order to catch cute animals falling from the sky. If the player raises their left hand, the basket moves to the left. If the player raises their right hand, the basket moves to the right accordingly. If the player raises both hands, the basket stops moving. Every time an animal is caught, a sound unique to that animal is played. With each turn, the player has three lives, which means it is game over if they fail to catch three animals.
